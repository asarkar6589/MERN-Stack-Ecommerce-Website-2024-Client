                <div className="mb-6">
                    <h3 className="text-xl font-medium mb-2">Standard Shipping</h3>
                    <p>Standard shipping is the most economical option available to our customers. It typically takes between 5 to 7 business days for orders to be delivered. This option is suitable for customers who are not in a hurry to receive their items and prefer a cost-effective solution.</p>

                    <p>For customers who need their orders faster, we offer expedited shipping, which usually takes between 2 to 3 business days. This option comes at a higher cost but ensures quicker delivery times, making it ideal for urgent purchases.</p>
